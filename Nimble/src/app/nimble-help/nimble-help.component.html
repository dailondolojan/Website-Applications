      feel comfortable and confident using their devices.</p>

      <li>Common icons</li>
      <li>How to use apps on mobile devices</li>
      <li>Gestures for touchscreen devices</li>
      <li>More!</li>

    <b>How should Nimble be used?</b>
    <p>Nimble is designed as a tool to help teach navigation skills, not as a standalone
      teacher. We recommend using Nimble with a human helper and practicing the skills
      you learn on your own devices.</p>
