		<b>How are icons designed?</b>
		<p>Icons are often designed based on their real-world counterparts. For example, the icon for "delete" is often represented
	as a trashcan.</p>
	<p>At the end of this section, you can test your skills with a matching game. The icons are randomized so you can play again multiple
		times.
